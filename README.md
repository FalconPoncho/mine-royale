# Mine Royale

A Minecraft datapack for the minigame Mine Royale. To play the game, first
create a save file with this datapack enabled to generate an underground cave
world. Then, run `function logic:setup` followed by `function logic:start` to
begin the game.

## Roadmap

This is a work in progress. Currently implemented features are:
- World generation
- Item shop menu
- Batch file to easily create new items

Planned future developments:
- Open item shop menu without commands
- Trade ores for money
- More buyable items
- Victory conditions
- Better world generation
