# Mine Royale

A Minecraft datapack for the minigame Mine Royale. To play the game, first
create a save file with this datapack enabled to generate an underground cave
world. Then, run `function logic:setup` followed by `function logic:start` to
begin the game.

- World generation

Planned future developments:
- Batch file to easily create new items
- Open item shop menu without commands
- Trade ores for money
- More buyable items
